Web app that helps to manage an hotel. There is a front-office, where all you can do is check the rooms and their clean record, 
and a back-office as an Admin, where you can CRUD rooms and their clean records, and one as a regular user with less actions.

## The goal to achieve
This was the final project for the subject for Web App Deployment. We had to build a Node web app and deploy it later on 
on a Debian server. During a short period of time, my app was online and accessible!
We had to use Express.js and Nunjucks, alongise MongoDB to store the data.

I really like how did it came out. It is a quite simple web app, but it clearly differences the roles and keeps track of 
the session with the JWT. Had a lot of fun using Express! <3
